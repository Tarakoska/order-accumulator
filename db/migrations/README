Single-database configuration for Flask.

For simple database changes, change the models directly and generate a new migration script.

To create a new migration script run:
```console
python3 groupbite.py migrate
```

Please review the generated miration because alembic cannot detect some changes:

The migration will automaticall applied on application startup.
